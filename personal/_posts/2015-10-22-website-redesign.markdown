Iâ€™ve gone ahead and decided to start using Jekyll to work on my blog. Although there were a few hitches in getting it setup, I am really enjoying using Markdown and the Liquid Templating language. Although the site is being compiled to static HTML to be served on Github, it almost feels like I am working on a dynamic site due to the power of the included technologies in the framework.
