I recently purchased a copy of Komplete 10 as the DAW I use (Reaper) doesn’t include that many VSTis, and it comes with no sampled instruments at all. My first foray into commercial music production software was the purchase of ValhallaDSP’s [ValhallaRoom] which greatly improved the overall sound I was able to get out of the free VSTs I had found and used up to that point. However, once I bought [PianoTeq 5] I realized just how much better commercially produced VSTis could sound.

Eventually I decided upon buying Komplete 10, as it seemed to come with a great variety of VSTis and VST effects. I’ve since spent a good deal of time with it, and I’ve probably only explored about 20-30% of what it has to offer. Below I’ve included two of my most recently made songs using this software.

Note: These songs require HTML5 to play. However, you can find them on my [Newgrounds Page] which uses a flash based audio player.
