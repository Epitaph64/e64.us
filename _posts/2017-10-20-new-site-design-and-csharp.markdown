I recently redesigned the site using [jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync] as a starting point (thanks shakeShane for providing this!) I created a basic customized scss style to fit my personality and the coding/tech slant that my blog will likely continue to enjoy.

Additionally, I've been working on an open source (MIT licensed) project to make it easier for people to create interactive digital stories. The software loads in a YAML formatted file and allows the story-teller to customize the story quite extensively (the hierarchy is nothing more than "pages" which can be connected in a graph-type system in any way imaginable, including with loops.)
